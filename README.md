# Post-scarcity Framework

An interactive framework for understanding progress across multiple domains in an assumed abundant future.

Many pundits, perticularly the tech bros building the generative AI frontier models are predicting a post-scarcity future possible within variable timeframes, from 5 to 20 years. Along the way they also acknowledge that the transition will at best tumultuous and also possibly an extinction event. This small exercise is to take the optimistic side of the predictions, but recognize that humans have an opportunity for new responsibility and not become infantilised by the ease of abundance and availability of distraction (starting with the excess of streaming entertainment and gaming that many nation's citizens already have access to). 

Some other writing and experiments on this are:

## Purpose

This framework aims to replace the current global "stress and debt" culture with empowering direction. It offers a conceptual scaffolding for navigating progress across biological, cultural, technological, and consciousness-based domains in the short term (decades). The plan is to allow the domains to be edited for your own purposes, the defaults are just the best practices that the author has identified.

## Structure

### Meta-Layer: Cosmic Reciprocity + Wisdom

Wake up or Grow up? 

The governing consciousness that spans all domains below. Progress without this meta-layer becomes destructive extraction.

**Cosmic Reciprocity:** The mathematical law of universal balance. "If you help others, you will be helped, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps in one hundred years, but you will be helped. Nature must pay off the debt. It is a mathematical law and all life is mathematics." (Gurdjieff/Bennett)

**Wisdom:** The discernment to know how, when, and whether to act. Wu-wei (non-action) as operational mode - governing like frying a small fish, where too much poking ruins it.

Together, these prevent scenarios like strip-mining celestial bodies for computronium - progress that prioritizes expansion without considering reciprocal maintenance of cosmic systems.

### Six Domains of Progress

Each domain operates at both individual (micro) and collective (macro) scales - "as above, so below."

1. **Exploration** - Space/multi-planetary, mathematics, physics, biology, nanotechnology
2. **Psychological Health** - Education, cognitive bias reduction, meditation, neural modifications
3. **Transhumanism** - Life extension, physical augmentation, consciousness upload, human-machine integration
4. **Society** - Alternative economics, new governance, cultural evolution, play-based structures
5. **Spiritual/Psychic/Magic** - Paranormal exploration, energetics, consciousness research, belief system evolution
6. **Aesthetic/Creative Progress** - Novel art forms, sensory experiences, new beauty paradigms

## Using the Visualization

**Main View:** The architectural monument shows the meta-layer as a golden slab resting on six vertical pillars (domains). This visual metaphor represents how wisdom governs all foundational domains.

**Interaction:**
- Hover over any pillar or the meta-layer to see it lift and glow
- Click to view detailed practices within that domain
- Each practice is labeled as Individual, Collective, or Both scales
- Use the scale filters to view practices by specific scale

## Key Principles

### As Above, So Below

True progress requires embodiment at both scales. Individual practices (meditation, personal creativity) and collective structures (governance systems, cultural frameworks) must develop in parallel. One without the other creates imbalance.

### AI's Role

AI augments intelligence but shouldn't lead where human experience and values are central:
- **High contribution:** Exploration, Transhumanism (pattern recognition, optimization, simulation)
- **Augmentative:** Psychological Health, Aesthetic/Creative Progress (tools for new capabilities)
- **Human-led:** Society, Spiritual/Psychic/Magic (meaning-making, empathic navigation)
- **Wisdom meta-layer:** AI can model consequences but cannot replace human judgment

### Prevention Over Regulation

The meta-layer isn't bureaucratic regulation. It's elevated judgment that sees the whole system - like philosopher-kings, but with AI-augmented wisdom systems (simulations, bias checks, consequence modeling) feeding human discernment.

## Background

This framework draws from:
- Gurdjieff/Bennett's Fourth Way (reciprocal maintenance, cosmic law)
- Taoist wu-wei (Chapter 57, 60, 63 of Tao Te Ching)
- Contemporary transhumanist and futurist thought
- Cultural progress theory

The goal is rigorous conceptual frameworks that operate across individual and collective scales to empower people with direction toward meaning and purpose.

## Technical Implementation

Built with React, using Tailwind CSS for styling. The visualization creates an architectural metaphor where structure conveys meaning.

*Each domain manifests at individual and collective scales. The meta-layer ensures all progress serves universal balance and employs proper discernment.*
